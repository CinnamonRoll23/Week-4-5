            <h2>Our personal thougts</h2>
            <p>Have you discovered your true passion in life? For me, it’s been taking a while. Sometimes I feel stuck and can’t 
                seem to figure out what I like to do. I regret that I wasted my schooling years trying to earn achievements and success. 
                In the movie, it was presented early on that viewing life as a race is not a good option. It was also clear that our school system is faulty. 
                It doesn’t encourage learning as much as achieving.</p>
